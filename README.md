## Game Programmer

I'm a passionate professional programmer who loves to design and develop game-focused applications.

### Background

I'm a game programmer, currently based in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. I have worked on variety of projects, from an individual looking solely on diferent production phases of an project to someone who works within a team and go through different life-cycles of a project. I graduated from A.Q.Khan Institute of Computer Science and Information Techonology, with First-class bachelors in IT. Interactive Entertainment: Game Development, Game Optimization and have commercial Programming experience.

As a game programmer, I take a lot of joy in being able to continually work on a variety of different projects as it forces me to interact with new technologies, work with new people and consistently allow me to keep growing and learning. It always feels like an adventure to being able to always work on the most interesting up-and-coming opportunities that present themselves to you. My passion truly lies in game development. I love being able to design and develop interactive experiences that can be enjoyed globally by a wide-range of different audiences. I also love being able to create and experiment with the development of indie tools, as it gives me a chance to try and give back to the community I work in and hopefully make the lives of my fellow developers easier.
